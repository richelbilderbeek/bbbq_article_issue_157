\caption{Percentage of epitopes derived from a TMHfound in the two elution studies, for the two different kind of topologyprediction tools. The values between braces show the the number ofepitopes that were predicted to overlapping with a TMH per allepitopes that could be uniquely mapped to the representative human reference proteome.}
